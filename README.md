The dataset contains sales data of a Turkey-based company that sells tobacco products.
The data covers a period of 2 years from 2020 to 2022.
The company has several product categories, including cigarettes, cigars, and pipe tobacco, among others.
The dataset contains information on sales volume, revenue, and profit for each product category and year.
The dataset could be used to identify trends and patterns in the company's sales, as well as to perform forecasting and optimization analyses.

In this project, we will perform a descriptive analysis to show how well or poorly sales are going in the company,
We will measure customer engagement through a cohort analysis, try to calculate the earnings for the coming months and analyze the customers who will bring the most profit to the company.
